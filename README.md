This is a simple program that gets the config.xml file, and then reads the contents. For the subdomains the program will find the subdomain, get the text from the tag and then append it to a list. After all the subdomains are appended to the list it will convert the list to json, and then store it into Redis with the key: "subdomains". Next we will find all the cookies in the cookie ele ment. We get the attributes and we create the key: "cookie:%name%:%host" and the value will be the text from that tag. I also create the docker container to set up the environment to run this program, and a container for my redis server. To see all the keys. We can run `app.py config.xml`.
